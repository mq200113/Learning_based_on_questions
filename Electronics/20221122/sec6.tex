\section{Amplifiers}

What is the lien between $p$ and $j\omega$? Why for a operational amplifier we have
$$
\frac{V_s(j\omega)}{\varepsilon(j\omega)}=\frac{A_0}{1+j\frac{\omega}{\omega_0}}
$$

What is the significance of the product of passed band gain? Why is there a limitation in frequency for the operational amplifier? How to analyze a real operational amplifier with the source of current?

Why is a operational amplifier not always be a comparator? Since the caracteristiques for a operational amplifier should be almost the same according to me?
