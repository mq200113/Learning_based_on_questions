Dear me in a future day,

I am in a very dangerous situation, where there are no more than three days for me to preparing the exam on electronics, 
so I have to learn all these stuffs in very few time. I hope you could somehow understand my plight, and finishing patiently the holes that I
have left, since I found that this could be somehow useful, and there is really some interesting thing. 

Thanks for your time and considerations.

Sincerely,

Qi Meng
