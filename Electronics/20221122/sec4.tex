\section{Components of semiconductor}
I don't quite understand why one gives me the current caused by the minority carriers, i.e.
$$
I_S=I_0e^{-\frac{qV_0}{\kappa T}}
$$
and
$$
I_D=I_S(e^{\frac{qV}{KT}}-1)
$$

When we want to analyze the diode, we need to follow the convention for receptors, and we need to simplify the diode to a wire or a source of tension or a switch. But I don't quite understand where does the source of tension comes from?

Notice what is the difference between the Zener diode and ordinary diode.

There are four parameters which are important to depict the working mode of a bipolar transistor: $V_{BE},I_C,I_B,V_{CE}$. Why diodes and transistors share a common value of tension $0.6\text{V}$?

What does a source of tension with an arrow mean in the diagram?

One does not tell me how $I_{E}$ behaves.
